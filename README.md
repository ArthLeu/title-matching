# Title Matcher

**A project by Anthony Liu and Alex Salman**

Last modified 05/03/2021

## TODO:
1. ~Enable searching with multiple labels (exact match)~
2. ~Finish `eval.py` with the given evaluation algorithm~
3. ~Analyze evaluation results with plots (false positive, false negative)~
4. ~Modify `main.py` so that it can run on Kaggle _do we submit results in .csv?_~
5. ~Optimization on computing time~
6. Approximations to labels in training set (neural network may be required)
7. Detections of labels not matching with any in the training set (heuristics)
8. Optimization on computing time (modern IR methods or term indexing maybe?)

## FAQ

_Q: Why this is an IR project instead of an hodgepodge of algorithms?_

A: There are 4 components of an Information Retrieval system, "acquisition", "representation", "file organization", and "query". Although we are working primarily on string matching, this process is essential for the "query" component, where a query like "how many time XXX dataset was mentioned" is passed in. Therefore, we must devise a robust platform where documents are efficiently processed and stored, and where queries like this would receive accurate feedbacks.
